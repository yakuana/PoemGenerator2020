# PoemGenerator2020

Your computational poet must meet the following requirements:

- [] Your system should generate and evaluate its own poetry.
- [] The poems may take on any aesthetic form except haiku.
- [] It should "speak" a generated poem aloud using a text-to-speech (TTS) technique in addition to displaying the poem on the screen. (It would be a good idea for your system to save its work so that it can re-perform generated pieces you found particularly interesting!)
- [] Its code should be written in 
      - [] (1) Python - either v2 or v3
      - [] (2) 1+ languages that will enable the generated poetry to be experienced via a website (e.g., Python/Django, HTML/CSS/JS, Python-based Twitterbot, etc.) 
- [] Its code should follow a consistent, organized, and readable programming style.
- [] You are welcome to use any libraries or resources as you wish to complete this assignment. However, as usual, you must fully credit any external sources.
- [] Your system is also allowed to be interactive (e.g., accept a noun prompt) or incorporate other forms of art (such as animation).
